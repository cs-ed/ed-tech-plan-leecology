# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of my educational plan is to make a roadmap for a future course that I want to teach. I was asked to get my Supplemental Computer Science Authorization for when the current electives teacher retires. I do not currently have access to the room or any subsequenct technology, but want to come up with how I will use Computer science skills when I am able to teach the class.  

## Context

### Course

The course that I am going to teach in the future is Animaker Space. This is a generalized STEAM electice class for 7th and 8th grade students made in partnership with Garner Holt Labs. The class is meant to introduce students to a variety of skills and tools, from Coding, 3d printing, CNC machines, animatronics, laser cutting, 3d modeling, and more. 
Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

### Situation

I currently work at a middle school with 7th and 8th grade students that is a title I school. The school is located in San Bernardino County, in Redlands Unified School District. Around 50% of the students Latinx students, around 30% White, 10% Asian, and 10% Black. A majority of the students are low income. The students all currently assigned Chromebooks. I do not have access to the campus over summer, but the Chrombooks were purchased in 2020. The course that I will be teaching had grant funding to help get it started, had has some tower computers and laptops, that all have 16 Gb of Ram and 1 Tb of memory. Some of the constraints are with regards to software. There is not further funding allocated, which means that any and all software will need to be freely accessible to students. This also means that I will not be able to assign work outside of class, since the students will not have hardware with the proper specifications or software to complete assignments, as well as many students not having internet access at home. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

#### Student Technologies #####
During the class, we will be using several different softwares: *Visual Studio Code, GitHub, MakeArcade, Slack, problems.org, W3Schools, and Piazza*

Visual Studio Code is a way to edit code, and to see the changes that you are making to it in real time on the computer. 
Github will be used to upload the code and to make websites for the students.
MakerArcade is an online website that will be used for teaching the basics of coding to students in a block based format. 
Slack will be used as a way for students to communicate with each other about work in our class and to help each other out. 
Problet.org will be used for assignment autograded problets for students in class to help them practice reading and writing code
W3 schools will be used to help teach about coding and assigning problems. 
Piazza will be used to create class message boards for general problem solving asynchronously and across different classes. 

#### Teacher Technologies #####

GoGuardian is a software that my school uses to monitor what websites students are using and to block access to specific sites. 
Github autograder will be used to check student code and give automated feedback to the students. 

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

I have limited knowledge that the current teacher told be verbally before he left for summer break. I do not have access to him or the school for several months. The hardware are a mixture of  tower computers and laptops, that all have 16 Gb of Ram and 1 Tb of memory. The tower computers are all plugged in via ethernet and hardwired to the wall. The laptops are connecting to the router to the school wifi. The students themselves will not have to provide anything on their own. 

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

With regards to homework, our school says that we cannot assignment any homework that the student cannot complete on the school assigned chromebook or with physical materials provided. As such, I will be limited in what can be assigned, and would not be able to use any of the above software. 
In the classroom, I plan on assignmening problets through problets.org and W3Schools. Both of these programs provide real time, immediate feedback to students without any input from the teacher. This type of feedback is a much faster and more accurate way of helping to teach rudimentary coding rather than having the teacher check each student; it removes human error in grading, and gives student in the moment teaching that wouldn't otherwise be possible. These type of assignments are also targeted feedback that would students direct evidence on where they need help; it identifies where the errors are and makes them fix it in real time.

I would also plan on implementing both peer instruction and pair programming as part of the curriculum. I think that peer instruction would be a great unit opener when students are more unfamiliar with a topic, and would have a chance to anonymously voice their opinions and preconceptions. I would then have them redo similar questions at the end of the unit and see how the classes thinking had changed over time. In the middle of the unit, I would want to implement peer programming, especially with smaller problems, using the "driver and navigator" model. This not only helps to encourage social communication, but would also function as a built in support for students who are less confident in their knowledge and skills. 

These types of assignments would be given out with a flexible timeline, such as assigned on Monday and due by Friday. This way students who are diverse learners who need extra time would have flexibility on how and when they finish their work without being alienated by their peers or feel external time pressures. These programs also allow for IEP and SPED student accomodations. I am currently an inclusion science teacher at my school, and one of the most common ways that we adapt assignments for students is to reduce the volume of work without reducing the academic standards being covered. Both of the problet websites listed would allow for individualized changes and allow students with those IEP accomodations to have their academic needs met while still learning the same curriculum. 

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.

One of the most common problems I assume that I will run into will be plagerism and the use of AI in the classroom. With regards to plagerism, I am planning on implementing MOSS as an antiplagerism tool. While it will still be up to me to monitor and see why there are similarities, this should help to reduce copying. As far as AI and copying other people's work online, I am hoping to limit this using GoGuardian while the students are in the classroom. Goguardian has an option to only allow access to specific sites, which would prevent students from writing out their problems in AI programs such as ChatGPT and copying the response as their own work. I have mainly been using this tool as an "anti-game" tool, because students are so prone play in class. However, I am aware that some students will still find ways to use it, and will also use it outside of class. I also plan to showcase what AI can do, but also emphasize that the language models are not perfect, and that they may not necessarily do what you want when they give you code. I would probably show them putting in code as well as an error message to try to problem solve what is going wrong. Finally, I am planning to have students provide a "comments page" for their medium and long term projects that they will turn in. In essence, this will be them explaining in broad terms what they did and why they did it. I may have them do video recordings and submit those, or have it typed out. Due to the size of classes that I would teach, it wouldn't be especially time effective to talk to each student every time, but I believe that a pre-recorded video would suffice.

# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of my educational plan is to make a roadmap for a future course that I want to teach. I was asked to get my Supplemental Computer Science Authorization for when the current electives teacher retires. I do not currently have access to the room or any subsequenct technology, but want to come up with how I will use Computer science skills when I am able to teach the class.  

## Context

### Course

The course that I am going to teach in the future is Animaker Space. This is a generalized STEAM electice class for 7th and 8th grade students made in partnership with Garner Holt Labs. The class is meant to introduce students to a variety of skills and tools, from Coding, 3d printing, CNC machines, animatronics, laser cutting, 3d modeling, and more. 
Describe your course including the name, description, and grade level

### Situation

I currently work at a middle school with 7th and 8th grade students that is a title I school. The school is located in San Bernardino County, in Redlands Unified School District. Around 50% of the students Latinx students, around 30% White, 10% Asian, and 10% Black. A majority of the students are low income. The students all currently assigned Chromebooks. I do not have access to the campus over summer, but the Chrombooks were purchased in 2020. The course that I will be teaching had grant funding to help get it started, had has some tower computers and laptops, that all have 16 Gb of Ram and 1 Tb of memory. Some of the constraints are with regards to software. There is not further funding allocated, which means that any and all software will need to be freely accessible to students. This also means that I will not be able to assign work outside of class, since the students will not have hardware with the proper specifications or software to complete assignments, as well as many students not having internet access at home. 

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

WIth regards to homework, our school says that we cannot assignment any homework that the student cannot complete on the school assigned chromebook or with physical materials provided. As such, I will be limited in what can be assigned, and would not be able to use any of the above software. 

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
